# AccessUtilities
A collection of code useful for Microsoft Access Maintenance.  Including a way to track code changes with Source Control.
The code extracts all the properties of all forms, reports, and other objects; including database options and properties.
It also extracts all the code and macros into files.  You can then add the output to source control and use it to compare the current
version of the database with an older version to see what all changed; or to track your changes over time.
